# TicTacToe
This Tic-Tac-Toe game is a simple web-based application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project features a responsive 3x3 grid layout styled with CSS, where players alternate turns to mark cells as "X" or "O". JavaScript manages the game logic, including turn tracking, win/draw conditions, and resetting the board. The interface displays game status messages to guide the players and allows easy replay with a reset button. This project is ideal for learning core web development concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic in JavaScript.
